					<p>
						From the first gambling games using dice in the casinos, to the various chess games played by common citizens, the identity of games has always been talked upon and described widely. Through the invention and challenge of games created through history, games are now a significant part of people's life when not working. Here at BASIS, we recognize student's interest, talents, and opportunities to play all sorts of games, and support them with various game clubs. We greatly wish that the students can have adequate relaxation while facing academic burdens.					</p>
