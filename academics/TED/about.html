                <div class="text">At the TED club, we engage in a variety of activities focused on exploring and discussing ideas worth spreading. We typically gather to watch and analyze TED Talks, which feature speakers sharing innovative ideas and perspectives on a wide range of topics, from science and technology to art, culture, and ski- i mean social issues.</div>
                <div class="text">During our meetings, we actively participate in thought-provoking discussions inspired by the TED Talks we watch. We encourage members to share their own insights, questions, and interpretations, fostering an environment of open dialogue and intellectual exchange. This collaborative approach allows us to deepen our understanding of the ideas presented and to gain diverse perspectives from our peers.</div>
                <div class="text">In addition to watching TED Talks and engaging in discussions, we also organize events such as public speaking workshops, where members can hone their presentation skills and learn how to effectively communicate their ideas. We may also invite guest speakers to share their expertise on specific topics, further enriching our knowledge and broadening our understanding of the world.</div>
                <div class="text">Overall, the TED club provides a platform for individuals to come together, learn from inspiring speakers, and engage in meaningful conversations that challenge our thinking and expand our horizons. Through our activities, we strive to foster a community of lifelong learners who are passionate about exploring new ideas and making a positive impact in the world.</div>
