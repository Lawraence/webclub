            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <b><h2 class="subtitle">Our Story:</h2></b>
            <p class="about">The first BASIS Curriculum School was founded by two economists, Michael and Olga Block, in 1998. With great prescience, they understood that in the 21st century we can no longer define educational opportunity in terms of a city, a state or even a nation. With technology and globalization changing our professional lives so dramatically, BASIS Curriculum Schools network built 60 schools across America, China, South-East Asia and Europe that seek to empower students with the capacity to navigate a rapidly changing and interconnected world.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <b><h2 class="subtitle">Our School</h2></b>
            <p class="about">As the first BASIS Curriculum School outside of the U.S., BASIS International School Shenzhen opened in Shekou Net Valley, Nanshan District, Shenzhen in 2015 after gaining authorization from the Department of Education of Guangdong Province. BASIS International School Shenzhen offers its rigorous BASIS Curriculum to students of Prek-1 to Grade 12, who are foreign passport holders or residents from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.</p>
            <p class="about">
            On July 29th, 2015, The Washington Post reported on the initiation of BASIS International School Shenzhen in an article titled BASIS, One of America’s Top Charter School Networks, Seeks New Turf: China, the first time it has ever done so for an international school in China. China’s domestic newspaper Reference News then translated and reprinted The Washington Post article.
