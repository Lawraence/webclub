		<h2>What is pre-med?</h2>
		<div class="page_img"><img src = "images/premed.jpg"></div>
	<p>Pre-med is an educational track or series of courses related to science that undergraduate students pursue to prepare for medical school. It is not a specific major; rather, it is a term used to describe the intention of a student to attend medical school after undergrad. Pre-Med requisites refer to the specific set of courses that undergraduate students must complete to be eligible for admission to medical school.</p>
