							<h4>Welcome to the official website of our international debate program! We are proud to present the rich history of our program, which has been making a positive impact in the world of debate for the past three years.</h4><br>
							<h3>Founding and Inception</h3>
							<p>Our debate program was established three years ago with a vision to promote critical thinking, effective communication, and the art of persuasion among students. It was founded by a group of passionate educators and debate enthusiasts who recognized the immense value of debate in developing well-rounded individuals. Founding leadership included Kiana Huang and Jasmine Ma.</p><br>
							<h3>National & International Footprint</h3>
							<p>Within the first two years of its inception, our program experienced rapid growth and gained popularity. We conducted debate tournaments, workshops, and training sessions, attracting students from diverse background. Our commitment to fostering a culture of intellectual exchange and respectful dialogue helped us become one of the leading debate programs in the country. Building upon our success at the national level, we expanded our program internationally in the third year. This marked a significant milestone for us as we aimed to create a global platform for students to engage in cross-cultural debates and share perspectives. We forged partnerships with debate organizations and schools worldwide, enabling us to organize international tournaments.</p><br>
							<h3>Community Engagement</h3>
							<p>Beyond competitive events, our program places great emphasis on community engagement and social impact. We actively encourage our students to utilize their debate skills to address real-world issues and effect positive change. Through collaborative initiatives, charity debates, and outreach programs, we aim to empower young debaters to become effective advocates for meaningful causes.</p>
							<p>Through collaborative partnerships with local organizations, we organize debate workshops, public debates, and educational initiatives in schools and community centers such as the Interschool Debate Competition. These programs provide opportunities for students who may not have had previous exposure to debate to learn essential skills, enhance their confidence, and develop a deeper understanding of complex social and global issues.</p>
							<p>By actively involving ourselves in the community, we aim to create a culture of intellectual curiosity, empathy, and social responsibility among our debaters. We believe that debate can be a catalyst for positive change and actively encourage our students to utilize their skills and knowledge to engage in meaningful discussions and contribute to their communities.</p><br>
							<h3>Collaboration with National Organizations in China</h3>
							<p>In our pursuit of fostering a global community of debaters, we have had the privilege of collaborating with two prominent national organizations in China: the Tournament of Champions (TOC) and the National High School Debate League of China (NHSDLC). These partnerships have allowed us to participate in their prestigious tournaments and contribute to the growth of debate in China.</p><br>
							<h3>Tournament of Champions</h3>
							<p>The Tournament of Champions is widely recognized as one of the premier debate competitions in China and in the United States. It brings together top debaters from across the country to engage in rigorous intellectual battles and showcase their skills on a national stage. We are honored to have been invited to participate in this esteemed tournament.</p>
							<p>Attending the Tournament of Champions has provided our students with invaluable opportunities to challenge themselves, exchange ideas, and learn from some of the brightest minds in Chinese debate. The competitive environment and high standards set by the TOC have pushed our debaters to refine their arguments, improve their delivery, and develop a deeper understanding of the art of debate.</p><br>
							<h3>National High School Debate League of China</h3>
							<p>The National High School Debate League of China (NHSDLC) plays a pivotal role in nurturing debate talent and promoting debate education in the country. As a partner organization, we have had the privilege of attending NHSDLC's tournaments and engaging with their vibrant debate community.</p>
							<p>Participating in NHSDLC tournaments has allowed our students to engage in thought-provoking debates on a wide range of topics, competing against some of the most talented debaters in China. The NHSDLC's commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive debate environment has not only sharpened our students' skills but also provided them with a deeper appreciation for diverse perspectives and cross-cultural dialogue.</p><br>
							<h3>Achievements and Recognition</h3>
							<p>Throughout our journey, our debaters have achieved remarkable success at both national and international competitions. Our students have consistently demonstrated exceptional eloquence, analytical skills, and the ability to present compelling arguments. Many of our participants have won prestigious awards and scholarships, further solidifying our program's reputation. Through their hard work and passion for debate, our students have earned national recognition and secured top rankings in the country.</p><br>
