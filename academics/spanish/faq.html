                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions for David about the club</h2><br>
                <h3 id = "orange">What will we learn in this club?</h3>
                <p id = "blue">From the name of this club, members will learn about Spanish. The category includes the Spanish language, which will be basic communication and understanding so that they can learn to chat with people in Spanish. Not only that, they will also explore different cultures of Spanish-speaking countries and acknowledge more about the Spanish world. Anyone can learn about Spanish, even if they have never even seen it before!</p><br>
                <h3 id = "orange">What activities will we be having?</h3>
                <p id = "blue">You can see more details in the <a href = "halloween.html" id = "red">Halloween Activity</a> and <a href = "activities.html" id = "red">Activities</a> pages. The majority of the activities we will have in the club would be based on Spanish cluture, as you can see in the images shown on those two pages. We will be doing all kinds of exciting activities, from making our own versions of Spanish art, to even hosting whole-school events if possible. Sign up and join the club to find out more, it is promised that you will like it!</p><br>
                <h3 id = "orange">Who are the leaders of this club?</h3>
                <p id = "blue">The leaders of this club are here to assist you! Anna Zhao has been the leader of this club for about two years, and this is her third year doing this. She is a senior (G12) this year and will be assisting and managing this club's schedules and setups for the school year. The new club leader this year is David Hou. This is his first year of high school as a freshman (G9) and also his first year leading this club. He has been part of this club for the last three years, even supporting it with his experienced Spanish language knowledge and interest. Last but not least, our club sponsor is Ms. Perla Hinojosa. She has been the sponsor last year and will also be sponsoring the club this year. All thanks to Ms. Perla for making this club's continutiy possible!</p><br>
                <h3 id = "orange">How good is your Spanish?</h3>
                <p id = "blue">For David, he speaks the language extremely well, and that would be how he is a new club leader this year. He has studied Spanish for three years and has a Spanish level equivalent to B1. Someone at B1 level may communicate like: "<i>Durante los vacaciones del verano, yo viajé a Atenas y Roma, dos cuidades muy antiguas y famosas, conocidas para su historia. ¿Cuánto sabes sobre aqellas ciudades?</i> (meaning "During the summer vacation, I traveled to Athens and Rome, two very old and famous cities, well-known for their history. How much do you know about those cities?")". This year, he looks forward to enhance his Spanish even more by educating others about it. For Anna, she has been studying Spanish for even longer than David has, and is likely the most experienced speaker in the campus!</p><br>
                <h3 id = "orange">How much Spanish will we learn in this club?</h3>
                <p id = "blue">In this club, a beginner could learn all the skills required to engage in a basic Spanish conversation, or to be able to understand basic Spanish. Club members should learn enough Spanish to say something like: "<i>Soy de Cuidad de Nueva York. Hablo español. ¿Cómo de tú, hablas español también?</i>". We promise to spread all that Spanish knowledge in this club!</p><br>
                <h3 id = "orange">How can I improve my Spanish?</h3>
                <p id = "blue">With this club, members are encouraged to learn and improve their Spanish every lesson when they can. If you are interested in learning even more Spanish, beyond the scope of this club for beginners, you can consider learning Spanish on your own. You can do that by finding a professional Spanish teacher, even though it is fairly difficult in China. The best way to study the language is through the online app I use to study my languages: <a href = "https://www.duolingo.com/" id = "green">Duolingo</a>. Duolingo features over 30 language courses for English speakers, as well as many other versions of the courses for foreign language speakers. It is completely free and is highly efficient for language learning. According to statistics, Duolingo teacher twice as good as most universities! Spending at least 20 minutes a day on the app learning a language can make you a great speaker in no time! You can learn any language, anywhere, anytime on the app. If you would like to start studying Spanish, the best way is to sign up for our club to learn basics with us, and then signing up for Duolingo to learn more advanced language skills!</p><br>
				<h3 id = "orange">How can learning Spanish be beneficial for me?</h3>
				<p id = "blue">Like any language, the main reason to study Spanish is for communication purposes. There are over 540 million Spanish speakers in the world, making it the third most widely spoken language (after English and Chinese) and the second most natively spoken. 21 countries around the world have Spanisg as an official language, including the United States. For travel and work purposes, Spanish can really help you communicate with other Spanish speakers whose English speaking is not very good. It can also be for your own purposes. BISZ offers an AP Spanish course for junior year high schoolers. Therefore, studying Spanish to a certain extent can get you taking one extra AP in your four years of high school! So why wait? Sign up for beginner lessons!</p>
                <h3 id = "orange">Got any other questions?</h3>
                <p id = "blue">Feel free to ask us! We will assist you anytime! More contact information in <a href = "contacts.html" id = "purple">Contact Us</a>.</p><br>
