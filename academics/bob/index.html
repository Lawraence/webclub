		<h2>INTRODUCTION TO BoB</h2>
		Battle of the Books is a club led by teachers and librarians, founded as a way to help children find more joy and companionship in reading. Over the year, club members read and discuss a selection of popular novels shared by readers all around the world. The club culminates in the “Battle of the Books” competition, where each BoB club competes to answer the most questions about the books they read.
