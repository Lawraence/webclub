                    <h2>Founder of Psychology</h2>
                    <h5>Wilhelm Wundt was best considered as the founder</h5>
                    <div class = "page_image"><img src = "w.jpg"></div>
                    <p>Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt was a German physiologist, philosopher, and professor, known today as one of the fathers of modern psychology. </p>
                    <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
                    <p> In 1879, at the University of Leipzig, Wundt founded the first formal laboratory for psychological research. This marked psychology as an independent field of study. By creating this laboratory he was able to establish psychology as a separate science from other disciplines. He also established the first academic journal for psychological research, Philosophische Studien, to publish the institute's research.</p>
