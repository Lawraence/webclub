          Shibei Chinese Literature Club held a club activity last month that was both entertaining and educational, which enriched on-campus experience and encouraged students to embrace Chinese culture.
          为了丰富在校师生的文化生活，鼓励大家拥抱中华传统文化，拾贝文学社于上月举办了一场兼具娱乐性和益智性的社团活动。

          At the event entrance, participants listened to songs with lyrics based on ancient Chinese poems and classic Chinese pop songs. The winner was the first student to identify the song title, the singer or the Chinese poem embedded in the lyrics.
          活动参与者首先在入口处进行听歌识曲，歌曲包含以中国古诗词为歌词内容的歌曲以及中文经典流行歌曲，能够率先辨别出歌名、歌手或者歌词中蕴藏的中国古诗词则胜出。

          The winners were full of excitement as they headed to the next stop, the handmade ice desserts with various ingredients, including peanut crumbs , glutinous rice balls, honey red beans, white sesame, sugar cinnamon, brown sugar syrup and etc. The club members also added horror elements and colorful exotic decorations to these desserts in order to present both traditional southwest Chinese culture and western festival features.
          每一位优胜者都满怀激动走向下一站——手工冰粉档，迫不及待地想要品尝一番专属美味。花生碎，糯米团，蜜红豆，白芝麻，糖桂花，红糖浆 ……除了食材丰富之外，社团成员们还别具匠心地引入了恐怖元素的糖果和彩色装饰，创造出了能展现中西方文化交融的独特佳肴。

          The second activity was a board game with the background story of Lost in Chinatown and unique traditional Chinese elements. Students articulated their ideas in a logical, coherent and fluent manner, trying to discover the mystery of the background story.
          此外，备受瞩目的活动环节莫过于展现口才辩论和逻辑推理能力的卡牌游戏。今年游戏主题是《迷醉唐人街》，由拾贝社团原创编写的游戏剧本以民国历史为背景，包含了丰富的中国传统元素，正如游戏主题一般，令参与者沉醉不已。

          The event was a tremendous success. The passionate students and teachers had great fun and gained a better comprehension of traditional Chinese culture. As the event organizer, Shibei Chinese Literature Club hopes that their voice will be heard and that more students will appreciate the beauty of Chinese traditional culture!
          此次活动气氛火热，广大师生乘兴而来，满载而归。作为活动主办方的拾贝文学社亦希望通过这些类型丰富的校园活动发出我们的心声，努力让更多的学生握住欣赏中国传统文化之美的钥匙！
