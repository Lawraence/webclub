                    The Pixel Art Project is the creation of Ms. Perla’s Grade 3 art class, as part of an initiative to add more creativity and significance to distance learning. For the project, students started with 2D pixel art, illustrating either a self-portrait or a character from video games like Minecraft or Among Us. Students then took the project to Mr. Davison’s engineering and technology class, utilizing Tinkercad, a 3D modeling program, to literally "add another dimension" to their artwork. The project demanded creativity, originality, and exercised students’ ability to form cross-curricular connections - nonetheless, each student exhibited their best effort, and many were able to produce elegant, unique illustrations and 3D models.

                    For the next phase of the project, middle and upper school students in the coding and web design elective (also taught by Mr.D), developed a website to showcase and publish the younger students’ work. The 2D pixel art and 3D representations would be displayed side by side in the Image Gallery Project; these students spent several weeks using HTML5/CSS/JS to perfect the aesthetics and functionality of the site. The project involved a great deal of logistical planning and organization, with nearly 500 unique files that had to be optimized and uploaded to the web server.
